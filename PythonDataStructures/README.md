## 🌟 Course Overview
This course was my next step after completing the beginner-level course in Python. It focused on understanding and working with **data structures**—one of the most important skills for any programmer. I learned how to store, organize, and manipulate data in Python using lists, dictionaries, and tuples.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Here are some of the key concepts I explored during this course:
- **Lists**: How to create, access, and modify lists, as well as list comprehensions for cleaner code.
- **Dictionaries**: Using key-value pairs to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Tuples**: Immutable collections and their unique use cases.
- **Files in Python**: Reading, writing, and processing data from files.
- **Sorting and Data Processing**: Techniques to sort and filter data using Python.
